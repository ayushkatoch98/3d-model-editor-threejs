Go to the OneDrive folder we’ve created for you, via the link below to obtain various 3D
assets for use in this test: <link>

Use this other link to get an idea of what we’re looking for in terms of the basic 3D web
animation; drag and drop the 3D sofa we’ve provided or any scene you create for this
purpose: <babylonjs.com>

- [done] Now create a 3D empty scene where you can implement your own settings such as
lighting, objects, animations, etc. and be able to modify them within the scene.

- Add a pop-up on the posters provided in the OneDrive folder, where when the mouse
hovers over it, a “glow” will appear meaning that you can interact with it and when you click on it, information about that object will appear.

- [done] Create settings where you can change the colour of the 3D objects with simple materials
provided for you within the Web.

- [done] Add some code that will redirect the user to a web site or to another scene.

- [done] Finally, create the ability for placement and moving of the objects in the scene.

- All settings need to be visible, intuitive and easy to use for users and incorporated into
one single scene.






- Later on – but not as a part of this test - you will need to implement character
animations and controller.

You will need to demonstrate that the scene you’ve created will be responsive and
function just as well on a desktop or laptop (of any size) as well as a smartphone.
When you’ve finished the test, please share a link to your GitHub repo as well as a link to
your deployed application - for example on Netlify - before your follow up interview for the
team to review.

In the next stage of your interview process, you will be asked to take the team through
what you’ve made, both looking at the code and demonstrating the UI via screenshare
over Zoom from your computer (i.e. not your phone).
If there’s anything else at all that you would like to show us during this next stage of your
interview process, please let us know in advance.
Thank you for taking your time with this assessment and best wishes for your success!
